When I was just a little girl

I asked my mother what will I be

Will I be pretty,

will I be rich

Here's what she said to me

<br />

Que sera, sera

Whatever will be, will be

The future's not ours to see

Que sera, sera

What will be, will be

<br />

When I grew up and fell in love

I asked my sweetheart what lies ahead

Will we have rainbows day after day

Here's what my sweetheart said

<br />

Que sera, sera

Whatever will be, will be

The future's not ours to see

Que sera, sera

What will be, will be

<br />

Now I have children of my own

They asked their mother what will I be

Will I be handsome,

will I be rich

I tell them tenderly

<br />

Que sera, sera

Whatever will be, will be

The future's not ours to see

Que sera, sera

What will be, will be

<br />

Que sera, sera
